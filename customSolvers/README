# first we go into the file folder dumbBuoyantPimpleFoam to wmake the file.

#the new compile file is restored in the $FOAM_USER_APPBIN/dumbBuoyantPimpleFoam

# in that file we compile a new solver named dumbBuoyantPimpleFoam in .C file we add two lines: using namespace std; cout << "test for user_solver <<endl; "

# in that folder in Make directory, files have been changed a little.


# at last, you can use hotroom to have a test. allrun_selt is a changed one, in it we use our self_solver dumbBuoyantPimpleFoam to execute the program.
